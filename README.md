## The Story Behind It
I remember spotting a phishing scam that slipped past basic filters‚Äîgot me thinking, why not train AI to catch the sneaky stuff? SecureAI-Bridge is my answer: a space to prototype tools that fuse AI with cyber defense. From spotting intrusions to automating intel, it's proof I can build systems that scale. Great for learning, but aimed at real impact‚Äîlike reducing breach risks in small teams or startups.

## Core Experiments
Focusing on practical builds‚Äîhere's the lineup, with early wins.

- AI Intrusion Detection: ML models flagging anomalies in traffic logs.
- Phishing Hunters: NLP parsing emails for red flags, with 90% hit rates in tests.
- Threat Intel Bots: Scraping and analyzing feeds for proactive alerts.
- Encrypted AI: Exploring homomorphic encryption for secure model training.
- Malware Spotters: Deep learning classifiers on binary files.

| Experiment | Progress | Key Metric | Next Step |
|------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| IDS System | ‚úÖ Working Prototype | 87% Detection Rate | Add Real-Time Streaming |
| Phishing Detector | üõ†Ô∏è Tweaking | F1 Score: 0.92 | Integrate with Email APIs |
| Intel Automation | ‚¨ú Idea Stage | N/A | Build Dataset Curator |
